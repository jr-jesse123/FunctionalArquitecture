# FunctionalArquitecture

In this repo we can find some exercies based on the excelent book FsApplied  (https://www.demystifyfp.com/FsApplied/) that show how awsoeme it its write 
commercial applications in f#.

here it´s demonstrated how f#'s functional-first nature embraces naturally, idiomatically and succinctily conecpts as:
* DSLS
* UBITIQUOUS LANGUAGE
* CQRS (without of Mediator)
* EVENTSOURCING
* BOUDNDED CONTEXTS
* LAYERED DESIGN
* BDD (whitout specflow)
* REALTIME EVENTS WITH WEBSOCKETS
 

F#'s type Inferece really excels when created dsls, I´ve found reallly pleasent to write tests in bdd flavor like this

without needing any external resources except for 30 lines for defining the the dsl functions.
